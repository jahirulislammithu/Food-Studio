            <h2> About us </h2>
            <p> A decade ago, we set out to bring cooks together from all over to exchange recipes and to support each other in the kitchen. We wanted to create a buzzing place for others who do what we do all day long: talk about food! Since we started Food Studio (we cook 52 weeks a year, get it?), tens of millions of cooks and eaters have found their way to the site.  </p
